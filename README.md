The project was made only for the purpose of understanding the system processes, I do not want you to use it for evil.
Most of the program was developed largely with the help of neural networks 2 years ago. I did not finish the management
I recommend using either ngrock or Cloudpub to run the program.

If you have any questions, you can ask. In the future, I may improve the program.
